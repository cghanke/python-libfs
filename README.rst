libfs
======

A virtual filesystem based on llfuse_.
It presents a collection of files sorted by metadata.  
It is best explained by example.
The first implemented type is mp3-files, which are sorted  
by their id3-tags.  
The way it is presented is defined at mount-time.  
So you could sort them by Genre/Album/Year/Artist/Album  
or by Artist/Album.  
The filename itself is also generated by a user-defined pattern.  
You can access the metadata by '%{KEY}'  
In the id3-case the default filename is:  
"%{tracknumber} -- %{title}.mp3"  

The type of metadata supported is implemented by plugins, thus it is  
easy to extend.

Another plugin could be the exif, which reads the metadata of  
jpeg files.

You can also change the metadata of files by moving it to another location  
within libfs. For this, it is allowed to create new directories within a mounted libfs.
These will be lost when they are still empty and the libfs unmounted.

Usage
-----

libfs has two modes of operation :

* update:
  scan files under a given location to import it's metadata into 
  the database.

* mount :
  use the given database to present the data in a user-defined view.
